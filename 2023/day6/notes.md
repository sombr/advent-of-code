time t, distance d
acc = wait time

new distance > given distance

(wait time) * (given time - wait time) > given
0 <= wait time <= given time

this an upside down parabola

- wt^2 + time*wt - given > 0

wt^2 - time*wt + given < 0

let's find roots

D = time*time - 4 * 1 * given
D < 0 --> no win
D == 0 --> no win, tie
D > 0 --> some range

x = (-b +- sqrt(D)) / 2*a
x = (time +- sqrt(D) ) / 2
